# Backend Developer - Infinite Studio (AI Filmmaking Platform)

## About the Project

Infinite Studio is an AI filmmaking education platform that teaches creators how to produce professional-quality films using AI tools like Gemini, Nano Banana, and Veo. The frontend prototype is complete and we need a backend developer to fully integrate it with our database and build out the remaining API functionality.

## Current Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with Passport.js (already implemented)
- **Hosting**: Replit

## Project Scope

### What's Already Built
- Complete frontend UI (homepage, course pages, dashboard, asset store, checkout)
- Database schema (users, courses, lessons, enrollments, progress, assets, orders)
- User authentication (register, login, logout, session management)
- Basic course and enrollment API endpoints
- User profile management

### What Needs to Be Done

**1. Data Seeding & API Completion**
- Seed database with course content (2 courses, ~20 lessons each)
- Seed asset store items (textures, character sheets, LUT packs)
- Complete missing API endpoints for assets and orders
- Add proper validation and error handling

**2. Frontend-Backend Integration**
- Connect homepage to fetch courses from API
- Wire course detail pages to database
- Connect asset store to fetch products from API
- Implement course player with lesson data from database

**3. Transaction Flows**
- Complete checkout flow (create orders for courses and assets)
- Implement order history retrieval
- Build lesson progress tracking (save/restore completion state)
- Handle enrollment after successful payment

**4. Testing & Quality**
- End-to-end testing of user flows
- API endpoint testing
- Error handling and edge cases

## Deliverables

1. Fully functional backend with all API endpoints
2. Database seeded with real course and asset content
3. All frontend pages connected to live data (no hardcoded content)
4. Working checkout and enrollment flow
5. Progress tracking for course lessons
6. Documentation of API endpoints

## Requirements

- Strong experience with Node.js/Express and TypeScript
- Experience with PostgreSQL and ORMs (Drizzle preferred, Prisma acceptable)
- Understanding of session-based authentication
- Experience integrating React frontends with REST APIs
- Familiarity with TanStack Query (React Query) is a plus
- Good communication skills
